# Bloglist application

This repository corresponds to the exercises of the [Full Stack open course part 5](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5).

This is a simple frontend react app to access the backend
done in the previous part. This part also includes Cypress E2E testing.

## Actions

The application expects NODE_ENV, and PORT environment
variables to be defined to work properly.

*`npm start`

Starts app.

*`npm test`

Runs a batch of jest tests.

*`npm run cypress:open`

Starts cypress. Frontend and backend must be running to perform these tests.
